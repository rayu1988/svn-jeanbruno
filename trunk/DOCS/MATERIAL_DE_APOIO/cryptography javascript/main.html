<h1>JavaScript Crypto Library</h1>

<p>Traditionally, cryptography applications are written in fast and efficient mid 
to low-level languages such as Java or C/C++ respectively, but C/C++ comes with the 
cost of reduced portability between different types of system, and Java requires a 
Java Machine to be pre-installed on the client's machine. When presented with an 
operating system that is locked down, such as can be found on PCs in most public 
caf√©s, installing applications for working with encrypted data can become difficult.
<br /><br />
Writing a cryptographic application for handling a variety of different algorithms 
in Javascript (a client-side scripting language) would result in a highly portable 
web-based (and downloadable) application. Correctly packaged, this application could 
be used off-line, and on a wide variety of devices.
<br /><br />
This website is all about JavaScript Cryptography. There is a downloads section where
you can download a packaged version of this site for use on a portable device, or you
can connect to this page with your mobile. This site is entirely processed by the 
web browser you are running, there is no server-side processing of your data, which 
means nothing you enter into any of the fields thoughout this website is ever sent
to the server. This ensures the highest level of security of your data.
<br /><br />
This web site has been developed to be as compatible as possible with all devices and
browsers - all pages meet XHTML and CSS validation checks, and the JavaScript content
has been tested on mobile devices and several brands of browser.
<br /><br /><hr /><br />
Click on the link below to use double-window layout. This Requires a browser that 
can handle Frames. It is only intended for non-mobile users.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The algorithms list is essentially the contents page for this website, for those who
either can't or won't use the frames layout, such as mobile users.

There are two different packages you can download - one has images, one doesn't. The
downloads contain all pages within this website, except for the download pages.
They come in a variety of formats - <b>tar.gz</b>, <b>tar.bz2</b>, and <b>zip</b>.

<br />
This cryptography resource is intended for users and developers - the JavaScript used
within this application is not obfuscated in any way, and the file structure is
completely open - allowing you to view all of the files on this site. No index files
have been generated explicitly for this purpose.<br />
For security reasons, SHA-1 and MD5 checksums have been generated for all files on
the site, although this won't necessarily detect a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
These checksums can be viewed from each page, or from each files index.
<br /><br />
The bash scripts for generating some of the pages used throughout this site have also
been uploaded for your amusement. They are located within the <a href="files.html">base
directory</a>.
<br /><br />
This application has been developed for compatibility with Internet Explorer 6, 
Firefox 3.0, and Blazer 4.3 for Palm OS. This website contains images which aren't
essential to the use of this website - disable loading of images to lower bandwidth
and increase download speed.
