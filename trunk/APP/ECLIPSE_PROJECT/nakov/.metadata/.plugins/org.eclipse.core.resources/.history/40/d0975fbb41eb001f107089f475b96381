THIS ECLIPSE PROJECT TAKE REFERENCES TO NAKOV'S SOURCE CODE PROJECT AND HAS BEEN CHANGED PROJECT AND CONSEQUENTELY THIS README.
THE ORIGN TEXT FROM README WAS;
	To generate self-signed certificate for signing the applet, run generate-certificate.bat.
	
	To build the applet, run build-script.bat. Be sure to stop the Web browser (all its windows)
	and Java Plug-in before. Otherwise the file DigitalSignerApplet.jar will be locked and will
	not be replaced (access denied).
	
	To get a free e-mail certificate (PFX keystore with certificate, certificate chain and private
	key) for test purposes, go to:
	
	http://www.thawte.com/html/COMMUNITY/personal/index.html
	
	Alternatively to get a free demo certificate go to:
	
	http://www.verisign.com/client/enrollment/index.html
	or 
	http://secure.globalsign.net/
	
	
	After installing the certificate, export it from your browser as .PFX (or .P12) file.


... AND NOW IS;
 
	To generate self-signed certificate and the signed jar applet enough run build.xml in the build target.

By now, just has been changed the way of generate certificate jks and the signed jar applet.
The structure of the directory also has been changed.
