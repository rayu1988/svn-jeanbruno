commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
When writing a library it is very useful to log information. However there are many logging
implementations out there, and a library cannot impose the use of a particular one on the overall application that the library is a part of.
The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementations.
A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used with any logging implementation at runtime.
Commons-logging comes with support for a number of popular logging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a reasonably simple task.
