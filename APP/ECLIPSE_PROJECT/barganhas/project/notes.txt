Index Configurations
It's a good idea to occasionally move index configuration from datastore-indexes-auto.xml to datastore-indexes.xml, 
then disable automatic index configuration and test your app in the development server. 
This makes it easy to maintain indexes without having to manage two files, and ensures that your testing will 
reproduce errors caused by missing index configuration.
